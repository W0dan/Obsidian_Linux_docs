Linux is a [[FOSS]] operating system, contrary to Windows and Mac Os which are closed source operating systems. Most Linux distributions are quite centered around the [[Terminal]]. 
## Useful commands
Since Linux is rather centered around the terminal, it is very handy to memorize some commands:
* `ls` [[ls]]
* `chmod` [[chmod]]
* `chown` [[chown]]
