I use steam for most of my games. A few things need to be altered for the best experience. Check [www.proton.com](https://www.protondb.com/) to see how well your game is supported on Linux.

## Installation
- `yay -S steam`
- start Steam
- go to the `Steam` menu
- select `Settings`
- click on the tab `Steam Play`
- make sure that `Enable Steam Play for supported titles` and `Enable Steam Play for all other titles` are both checked.
- Don't change the `Proton` version for now. You might alter it when troubleshooting problems if/when they happen.
- You can also change the `Proton` version on per-game basis (which is usually the better approach)
