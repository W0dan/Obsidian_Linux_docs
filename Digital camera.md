**Disclaimer:** I use a canon digital camera (actually 2, a 200D and a 550D), the software below works with those cameras. I cannot guarantee compatibility with anything else.

## Needed software for digital camera support
- `gphoto2`
	- `yay -S gphoto2 gvfs-gphoto2`
- Thunar filemanager
	- The default filemanager of KDE Plasma doesn't support gphoto2, so you need to install an alternative
	- Other possibilities are: `Nemo`, `PCManFM`, ...
	- `yay -S thunar`
- Darktable
	- Needed for processing RAW files
	- `yay -S darktable`
